# WIP
This repo contains a heavily based on https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks comparison of different frameworks.

If you want to try it in its current state, do the next.
1. `npm i` in the root
2. `npm i` in every framework folder
3. `npm run build` before start in nest folders
4. `npm run start` in the root for basic comparison
5. `npm run start:timeout` for the comparison handlers with timeout
