# WIP
This repo contains a heavily based on https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks comparison of different frameworks.

If you want to try it in its current state, do the next.
`npm i` in the root
`npm i` in every framework folder
`npm run start` in the root for basic comparison
`npm run start:timeout` for the comparison handlers with timeout
`npm run build` before start in nest folders
